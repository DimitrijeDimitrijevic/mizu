	// Authentication errors. Structured SMTPErrors so the auth-failure code is
	// correct per RFC 4954 §6, which Outlook's setup wizard relies on: a
	// permanent 535 is a password prompt, a temporary 454 is read as "server
	// down" and aborts account creation.
	//
	// ErrAuthCredentialsInvalid: the auth backend has no such account (404) —
	// PERMANENT, because no retry makes an absent account appear. This is the
	// ONLY permanent auth failure. An account that exists but cannot be
	// authenticated right now — wrong password, no usable hash, denied
	// submission — gets the 454 below instead, since all of those can change
	// without the client altering anything.
	//
	// Note this is distinguishable from the 454 below, which an existing
	// account gets when its password is wrong, so the pair is a mailbox
	// enumeration oracle: one AUTH per address reveals which ones exist. That
	// is an accepted trade-off — a client that cannot tell "no such address"
	// from "server down" retries a hopeless address forever. The auth rate
	// limiter is what bounds the probing, since these attempts are now recorded
	// (see the RecordAuthAttempt gate in auth_session.go).
